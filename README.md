Quickly access recent files, files with a specific tag, files in the current
window, files in the `Downloads` folder, or trashed files.

## Usage
- Search for recently modified files in your home folder and iCloud documents
  with the keyword `rec`. ([Searching for recent files was always a weak
  point on
  macOS.](https://new.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1eiy0pa/recents_folder_on_mac_is_driving_me_crazy/))
- Access files in your `Downloads` folder via `dl`.
- Search for files in the front Finder window via `win`.
- Look for files in your Trash with `trash`.
- Access files you have assigned a Finder tag of your choice via `tag`.

For all fives cases, you can change the keyword in the workflow configuration or
set a [hotkey](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/).

The following actions are available for all searches:
- <kbd>⏎</kbd>: Open the file.
- <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Move the file to your front Finder window.
- <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Reveal the file in Finder.
- <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Copy the file to the clipboard.
- <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Y</kbd>: Quick Look the file.

For the tag search:
- <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Remove the tag from the file.
- Using the hotkey automatically opens the tagged file or folder, skipping the
  selection window.

## Installation
This workflow requires `ripgrep`:

```bash
brew install ripgrep
```

## Howto: Ignore folder for recent files search
1. Go to the folder you want to ignore.
2. Press `cmd+shift+.`, to show hidden files.
3. In that folder, create a file named `.ignore`, the file content should just
   be `*`. This ignores every file in that folder. (If you want more
   fine-grained control, the file uses the [gitignore
   syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).)
4. Press `cmd+shift+.` once more, to conceal hidden files again.
